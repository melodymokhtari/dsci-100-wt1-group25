    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to analyze player data from the PLAI Minecraft research server to understand what player characteristics are most associated with subscribing to the project’s newsletter. Subscribing is used as a measurement for player engagement as it suggests greater interest in contributing to research data collection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific question:**  \n",
    "Can we predict a player’s likelihood of subscribing to the newsletter using personal and in-game characteristics such as age, experience, and played hours? This predictive question will utilize classification methods, and will serve to respond to researchers' question #1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will focus on the `players.csv` dataset. This report includes a descriptive summary of the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations, and a proposed methodology for carrying out this project."

    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 196 observations in the `players.csv` file, each representing an individual player. The dataset contains 9 columns. Two of these columns were selected to include in this project's analysis. Of the remaining 7 variables, four are stored as objects (categorical or string), one is a float, one is an integer, and one is boolean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "- experience (object): player’s experience level in Minecraft (Amateur, Regular, Veteran, or Pro)  \n",
    "- subscribe (boolean): whether the player subscribed to the PLAI newsletter (True or False)  \n",
    "- played_hours (float): total hours played on the server  \n",
    "- name (object): player name (not used for modeling)  \n",
    "- gender (object): gender identification (Male, Female, Other, Prefer not to say, etc...)  \n",
    "- age (integer): player’s age in years\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some issues with the data that may result in problems moving forward: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a class imbalance: more players are subscribed than unsubscribed.  \n",
    "- Some ages appear unusually high (e.g., 91) for a typical player, which may be an outlier.  \n",
    "- `experience` must be converted into numeric format for modeling.  \n",
    "- There are no missing values, but some numeric variables may contain mostly zeros, which could reduce their usefulness in modeling.\n",
    "The data was collected from the PLAI Minecraft server and participant registration system, so in-game variables (like hours and experience) considered in the context of this project reflect real and accurate gameplay metrics."

    "\n",
    "We conducted a supervised classification analysis to predict whether a player will subscribe to the PLAI Minigame newsletter. In classification, we use labeled examples to learn a rule that maps a set of input features (predictor variables) to a categorical outcome (the response). Here, the response variable is `subscribe`, and the predictors include player-level characteristics such as age, played hours, and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to conduct this classification. KNN predicts the class of a new observation by identifying the K most similar observations in the training data and assigning the most common label among them. Similarity is measured using distances with this method; because KNN relies directly on distances, appropriate preprocessing and tuning of K are essential to achieve reliable predictions."

The training set is used for model fitting and tuning, while the test set is held out for final performance evaluation. Moreover, because KNN uses distances between observations, predictors measured on larger numeric scales can dominate the neighbor search. To ensure each predictor contributes comparably, we standardized the numeric features. This improves the interpretability and reliability of the KNN model."

    "By scaling the dataset, changing `experience` to binary results, and applying classification methods, we are able to put together a final model. This model can be used to predict the likelihood of a player subcribing to the game's newsletter based off their own characterics such as age, played hours and experience. The accuracy, precision and recall of the model are calculated to ensure that the model was giving us well-calculated predictions. Above shows an example of this model is use.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this assignment, we expected to find a well curated model to help us find an answer to our question: can we predict a player’s likelihood of subscribing to the newsletter using personal and in-game characteristics such as age, experience, and played hours? We also wanted to make sure that the model was able to have a good accuracy and precision, as having an unfit model could serve us inaccurate results. When we were able to put together the final model and read in its accuracy, precison and recall scores, we were satisfied with the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question asked by the researchers was: “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting back to the first question asked by the researchers, the model created can now be used to obtain a much better understanding of the game’s target demographic. This can lead to better advertising towards a certain group of people in terms of their age, experience and playing hours. This can also help them customize the game to further customer experience to attract more people to the game. With all of this, the game could see a larger amount of players subscribing to their newsletter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further questions can be asked with this new model and its impact, such as how can the process of subscription be changed to truly optimize how many people subscribe? How does subscribing to a newsletter relate to engagement across other channels (e.g., social media, in-game events, email promotions)? Understanding whether the newsletter subscribers are more likely to engage in other channels could help the researchers target players with a multi-channel approach to increase game visibility and retention. This can connect back their individual characteristics and whether there is any connections. Another question that could be asked in the future is what are the most common drop-off points in the subscription funnel (e.g., from website visit to sign-up, from sign-up to email confirmation)? Analyzing where players drop off in the subscription process can improve the user experience and increase conversion rates. In addition, this model is very helpful in understanding certain aspects of players and how it impacts their likelihood to subscribe, but could it be same for a paid subscription? How do these players differ from those who opt for free newsletters?"
