    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to analyze player data from the PLAI Minecraft research server to understand what player characteristics are most associated with subscribing to the project’s newsletter. Subscribing is used as a measurement for player engagement as it suggests greater interest in contributing to research data collection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific question:**  \n",
    "Can we predict a player’s likelihood of subscribing to the newsletter using personal and in-game characteristics such as age, experience, and played hours? This predictive question will utilize classification methods, and will serve to respond to researchers' question #1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will focus on the `players.csv` dataset. This report includes a descriptive summary of the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations, and a proposed methodology for carrying out this project."

    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 196 observations in the players.csv file, each representing an individual player. The dataset contains 9 columns. For our predictive analysis, we selected three key predictors: age, played_hours, and experience, with subscribe as the response variable.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "- experience (object): player’s experience level in Minecraft (Amateur, Regular, Veteran, or Pro)  \n",
    "- subscribe (boolean): whether the player subscribed to the PLAI newsletter (True or False)  \n",
    "- played_hours (float): total hours played on the server  \n",
    "- name (object): player name (not used for modeling)  \n",
    "- gender (object): gender identification (Male, Female, Other, Prefer not to say, etc...)  \n",
    "- age (integer): player’s age in years\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some issues with the data that may result in problems moving forward: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a class imbalance: more players are subscribed than unsubscribed. This was addressed in the method. \n",
    "- Some ages appear unusually high (e.g., 91) for a typical player, which may be an outlier. We did not remove these higher ages because the dataset is small and we did not have evidence that these entries were errors. However, future work could test sensitivity to extreme ages. \n",
    "- `experience` must be converted into numeric format for modeling. This was addressed in the method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from the PLAI Minecraft server and participant registration system, so in-game variables (like hours and experience) considered in the context of this project reflect real and accurate gameplay metrics."

    "We conducted a supervised classification analysis to predict whether a player will subscribe to the PLAI Minigame newsletter. In classification, we use labeled examples to learn a rule that maps a set of input features (predictor variables) to a categorical outcome (the response). Here, the response variable is `subscribe`, and the predictors include player-level characteristics such as age, played hours, and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to conduct this classification. KNN predicts the class of a new observation by identifying the K most similar observations in the training data and assigning the most common label among them. Similarity is measured using distances with this method; because KNN relies directly on distances, appropriate preprocessing and tuning of K are essential to achieve reliable predictions."

The training set is used for model fitting and tuning, while the test set is held out for final performance evaluation. Moreover, because KNN uses distances between observations, predictors measured on larger numeric scales can dominate the neighbor search. To ensure each predictor contributes comparably, we standardized the numeric features. This improves the interpretability and reliability of the KNN model."

    "## Discussion \n",

    "In this project, we investigated whether player characteristics could predict newsletter subscription in the PLAI Minigame dataset. After cleaning the data, exploring engagement patterns, and addressing class imbalance, we trained and tuned a KNN classifier using age, played hours, and an ordinal numeric encoding of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final tuned model achieved 69.39% accuracy, 76.92% precision, and 83.34% recall on the test set. These results suggest that subscription is at least partially predictable from measurable player attributes. The high precision indicates that when the model predicts a player will subscribe, it is often correct. However, the moderate recall suggests that the model misses a meaningful portion of true subscribers. This outcome was generally consistent with our expectations. Exploratory analysis suggested that engagement (especially played hours) varies across experience levels and subscription groups, implying that a distance-based classifier could capture useful patterns. The original class imbalance also supported the need for a balancing strategy before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to respond to the first question asked by the researchers: “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?” Our findings could help researchers better understand which types of players are more likely to engage with newsletter-based research communications. A model like this could support more targeted outreach towards players based on their age, experience, and playing hours, thus reducing unnecessary messaging to players less likely to subscribe. Overall, age, played hours, and experience provide a modest but meaningful signal for predicting newsletter subscription in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further questions can be asked with this new model and its impact, such as how can the process of subscription be changed to truly optimize how many people subscribe? How does subscribing to a newsletter relate to engagement across other channels (e.g., social media, in-game events, email promotions)? Understanding whether the newsletter subscribers are more likely to engage in other channels could help the researchers target players with a multi-channel approach to increase game visibility and retention. This can connect back their individual characteristics and whether there is any connections. Another question that could be asked in the future is what are the most common drop-off points in the subscription funnel (e.g., from website visit to sign-up, from sign-up to email confirmation)? Analyzing where players drop off in the subscription process can improve the user experience and increase conversion rates. In addition, this model is very helpful in understanding certain aspects of players and how it impacts their likelihood to subscribe, but could it be same for a paid subscription? How do these players differ from those who opt for free newsletters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore additional predictors such as session frequency, time since account creation, or other in-game behavior metrics. It would also be useful to compare KNN with other classifiers such as logistic regression or decision trees to assess whether we can improve recall while maintaining strong precision."
